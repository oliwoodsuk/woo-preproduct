# Title: Remove Non-Plugin Files and Build Artifacts from zip script output
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Strip out non-plugin files like zip folders and build artifacts to comply with WordPress plugin review requirements
# Details:
Audit the plugin directory and remove or add to .distignore any build artifacts, zip directories, development files, or other non-plugin files. Create or update .distignore file to exclude these files from distribution. This is critical for WordPress plugin review approval.

Verify plugin directory contains only necessary plugin files, test that .distignore properly excludes development files, and ensure clean archive generation
