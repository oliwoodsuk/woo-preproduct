# Task ID: 7
# Title: Optimize Asset Loading and Scoping
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement conditional loading of scripts and styles based on admin/frontend context
# Details:
Implement proper asset loading strategies to only load scripts and styles when needed. Use is_admin(), current_screen checks, and page-specific conditions to load assets only on relevant pages. Implement proper script localization for AJAX calls and ensure all assets are properly versioned for cache busting.

# Test Strategy:
Verify assets only load on appropriate pages, test that no unnecessary scripts load on frontend, check admin functionality and AJAX calls work correctly
