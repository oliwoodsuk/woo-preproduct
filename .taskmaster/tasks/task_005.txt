# Task ID: 5
# Title: Prefix All Functions and Classes
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Add 'preproduct_' prefix to all functions, classes, constants, and option names to prevent conflicts
# Details:
Systematically rename all plugin functions, classes, constants, and option names to include the 'preproduct_' prefix. Remove any usage of 'woo_', 'wp_', or double underscores '__' prefixes. Update all references throughout the codebase including hooks, filters, and database option names. Ensure unique namespace to prevent conflicts with other plugins.

# Test Strategy:
Search for any remaining unprefixed names, test plugin activation and functionality, verify no conflicts with other plugins, check database options are properly prefixed
