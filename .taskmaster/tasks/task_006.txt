# Task ID: 6
# Title: Refactor Hook and Filter Usage
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update all WordPress hooks and WooCommerce filters to use the new prefixed function names
# Details:
Update all add_action(), add_filter(), remove_action(), and remove_filter() calls to reference the newly prefixed function names. Ensure callback functions match the renamed functions. Review all custom hooks and filters to ensure they follow WordPress naming conventions and use the preproduct_ prefix.

# Test Strategy:
Test all plugin functionality that depends on hooks and filters, verify WooCommerce integration still works, check admin and frontend features
