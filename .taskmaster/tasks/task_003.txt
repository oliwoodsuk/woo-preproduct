# Task ID: 3
# Title: Replace Inline CSS/JS with Proper Enqueuing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace hardcoded CSS and JavaScript with wp_enqueue_script and wp_enqueue_style calls
# Details:
Identify all inline CSS and JavaScript code throughout the plugin. Create separate asset files in /assets/css and /assets/js directories. Replace inline code with proper wp_enqueue_style() and wp_enqueue_script() calls, ensuring proper dependencies, versioning, and conditional loading (admin vs frontend). Implement script attributes like async/defer where appropriate.

# Test Strategy:
Verify no inline CSS/JS remains, test that all assets load correctly in admin and frontend, check for proper dependency loading and no conflicts
