== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this require a PreProduct account? =

Yes, you'll be prompted to create an account after opening PreProduct from your Wordpress admin.

= Will this affect my existing WooCommerce functionality? =

No, the plugin is designed to enhance your existing store without interfering with normal WooCommerce operations. It only adds pre-order capabilities to your products.

= How does the plugin detect which products should have pre-order functionality? =

Yes, the plugin automatically tags eligible add-to-cart buttons so that PreProduct understands which products they belong to. You can then list products for pre-order via the PreProduct app (either manually or via automation).

= What happens when I deactivate or uninstall the plugin? =

When deactivated, all PreProduct functionality is removed from your store (script and buy button attributes). 
When uninstalled, the plugin sends a notification to PreProduct and cleans up all stored data.

= Is the plugin compatible with my theme? =

Yes, the plugin works with any properly coded WooCommerce-compatible theme. It uses standard WooCommerce hooks and filters to add functionality.
Please get in touch if the integration isn't working as expected with your particular theme.

= How does the plugin handle different environments (development/staging/production)? =

The plugin automatically detects your environment and uses appropriate endpoints. Development environments (localhost, .test, .local domains) connect to PreProduct's development servers, while production sites connect to production servers.

= Are there any performance impacts? =

The plugin is designed for minimal performance impact. The PreProduct script is loaded with the `defer` attribute and only runs after your page has finished loading.
